This library is a wrapper to use Erasure-codes Libraries. It is based on Gibraltar interface.

Currently, 2 libraries are supported. To have them available, download and extract the library folder in the lib folder with its original name (specified below)
	- Jerasure, only RS encoding (Jerasure-1.2)
	- Gibraltar, using CUDA (libgibraltar-1.0)


USER: Examples are provided in the examples folder.
The interface is similar to Gibraltar's. You only need to include the wrapper (#include <ecwrapper.h>) in your source file and initialize the ecFunctions with the library you want to use.

DEVELOPER:
To add a new library to the wrapper, you need to provide the function to fill a ecFunctions structure and an initialization function. See jerasureCompatibility.c (in src) and .h (in inc) for more instructions.
